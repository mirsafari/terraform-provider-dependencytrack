## 1.26

#### FEATURES
- Add `dependencytrack_service_account`, `dependencytrack_workload_identity_provider` and `dependencytrack_workload_identity_binding` resources, requiring API v5.2+.

- `github.com/DependencyTrack/client-go`

#### ISSUES
- Importing a `dependencytrack_project` with a `collection.logic` of `"NONE"` results in `null` being stored in the Terraform state.

## 1.12.0

#### FEATURES
- Add `dependencytrack_ldap_team_mapping` resource to manage dynamic membership of Teams, from LDAP Servers.

- Remove issue comment triage workflow, as it is unused, and so causes unnecessary action runs.
- Update `docker_compose.yml` file to use an external `postgres` database, as recommended.
	- GitHub actions are lagging, due to inability to manage dependencies between job services.

#### ISSUES
- [Fixed in `1.10.2`] Comments on API keys are set to an empty string in state upon creation.
  - Thanks to [@acidghost](https://github.com/acidghost) for reporting.
  - https://github.com/SolarFactories/terraform-provider-dependencytrack/issues/72

## 1.10.0

#### FEATURES

#### DEPENDENCIES
- `actions/setup-node` `4.3.0` -> `4.4.0`
- `github.com/DependencyTrack/client-go` `0.15.0` -> `0.16.0`
- `golang.org/x/net` `0.37.0` -> `0.38.0`

#### ISSUES
- [Fixed in `1.12.1`] Permission list is assigned from a potentially `nil` `dtrack.Team`.

#### MISC
- Remove deprecated field from within `golangci` config file for `goconst`.

## 1.8.2

#### MISC
- Add support for DependencyTrack API `4.11.x`, updating README to reflect.
- Add testing of multiple DependencyTrack API versions in a matrix, as opposed to just `latest`
- Updated golang lint config to be strict, adding explicit exceptions.
- Add golangci config validation to `make lint` command.
- Add exclusion to `^TestAcc` when running `make test` as these tests are not run without `TF_ACC="1"`.
- Updated `ProviderData` from `*dtrack.Client`, to a struct containing `*dtrack.Client` and Semver information, for resources an datasources.
- Added request within Provider Configuration, to retrieve API version, to be used for compatibility within Provider.
- Increased verbosity of `Debug` logs within `dependencytrack_project`, to cover non-sensitive attributes.
- Added testing utilities, as well as validation of Semver value returned by API.

#### FIXES
- Set minimum TLS version used by TLS Client to Version 1.3, reducing security exposure from weak ciphers.
- Created separate `dependencytrack_project` within `dependencytrack_project_property` tests, due to intermittent timing issue when deleting multiple project properties in quick succession.
	- This is still an issue caused by DependencyTrack API, but is no longer affecting pipeline.

#### DEPENDENCIES
- `crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg` `6.2.0` -> `6.3.0`
- `goreleaser/goreleaser-action` `6.2.1` -> `6.3.0`
- `golangci/golangci-lint-action` `6.5.2` -> `7.0.0`

## 1.8.1

#### MISC
- Document in `README.md`, supported versions of Terraform, and DependencyTrack.

#### FIXES
- Using `dependencytrack_config_properties`, `dependencytrack_config_property`, or `dependencytrack_project_property`, with a `type` of `"ENCRYPTEDSTRING"`, would result in the value being replaced by the placeholder value from DependencyTrack.
	- Now the current value is persisted in the statefile, across operations.
- Marked `description` in `dependencytrack_project_property` as `Computed` to account for it changing from `null` to `""`, when it is not provided.

#### ISSUES
- Deleting multiple `dependencytrack_project_property` on the same `dependencytrack_project` in quick succession can cause intermittent errors. This is caused by a delay within deleting within the DependencyTrack API.

## 1.8.0

#### FEATURES
- Added ability to manage several attributes of `dependencytrack_project` Resource - `version`, `parent`, `classifier`, `cpe`, `group`, `purl`, `swid`.

#### MISC
- Increase quality of testing for where two id's are expected to match, rather than just both being set.

#### FIXES
- Fixed an update to `dependencytrack_project` Resource from overriding existing settings of unmanaged properties, i.e. previosuly `parent` when change `name`.
	- Now retrieves the current settings, before updating - as unable to use a partial `PATCH` - due to inability to unset optional fields, e.g. `parent`.
